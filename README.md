# LipRead
As a part of my final year project,I have been working on a lip-reading model using deep learning techniques.The main motivation behind this project is to aid people with hearing impairments.I have  implemented several strategies to come up with a novel architecture using 3DCNN,Bi-LSTM and Bi-GRU on GRID corpus dataset.
